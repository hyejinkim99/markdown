## Recommendation Algorithm

### Abstract
The criteria for recommending movies in `VIM PROJECTOR` are `rating` and `count`.

> `rating` is the average score of a movie that belongs to `genres` you input (`target genres`) and is rated by users belonging to your categories of `gender`, `age`, and `occupation` (`target users`).

> `count` is the number of ratings of a movie that belongs to the target genres and rated by the target users.

In our algorithms, movies with **high rating averages** will be selected as recommendations. In each step in the algorithms, rating data of the movies that fit the conditions (`target movies`) will be processed and sorted. Top N movies in the sorted list will be selected to be recommended, with N being the number of movies required.

For a movie to be recommended, the `rating average` of a movie must be **equal or above 3.5**, and the `count` of the movie must be **equal or above 1%** of the number of total rating data.

<br>

### Details

`VIM PROJECTOR` uses two different movie recommendation algorithms depending on different inputs, **user information** and **movie information**.

1. **Recommendation by user information**

   > By **user information**, we mean your `gender`, `age`, `occupation` and `genres` you wish to watch.
   > When given **user information**, `VIM PROJECTOR` will recommend movies that are in the **target genres** and have high ratings by **target users**.  
   > The steps in this algorithm are shown below.
   >
   > 1.  Generate a list of 10 recommended movies that are in the `target genres` and are rated highly by `target users`. If `target genres` are not given, the algorithm will search for and recommend movies in all genres.
   > 2.  If the number of movies in the generated list is less than 10, then expand the range of `target users` by expanding the range of `occupation` to **all occupations** and search again. Then add the recommended movies to the list.
   > 3.  If the number of movies in the generated list is still less than 10, then expand the range of `target users` again by expanding the range of `age` to **all age groups** and search again. Then add the recommended movies to the list.
   > 4.  If the number of movies in the generated list is still less than 10, then expand the range of `target users` once more by expanding the range of `gender` to **all genders** and search again. Then add the recommended movies to the list.

    <details>
    <summary>Show an example</summary>
    <div markdown="1">
    <br>

   > Let’s see an example of {`gender`: "m", `age`: "56", `occupation`: "k-12student", `genres`: "" } given as an input of **user information**. Since the genres field is not given, movies in all genres will be the candidates for recommendation.
   >
   > According to this algorithm, the generation of a movie recommendation list would follow the process shown below.
   >
   > 1.  A list of recommended movies is generated using the given `target user` data and `target genres` data. In this example, there is only one `target user`. The number of movies contained in this list of recommended movies is less than 10.
   > 2.  Since there are less than 10 movies in the list, expand the range of `target users` by allowing the search for **all occupations**. Now the conditions for the `target users` would be {`gender`: "m", `age`: "56", `occupation`: "", `genres`: "" }. Add the recommended movies based on the new range of `target users`.
   > 3.  If the number of movies in the generated list is still less than 10, then expand the range of `target users` by allowing the search for **all age groups**. Now the conditions for the `target users` would be {`gender`: "m", `age`: "", `occupation`: "", `genres`: "" }. Add the recommended movies based on the new range of `target users`.
   > 4.  If the number of movies in the generated list is still less than 10, then expand the range of `target users` by allowing the search for **all genders**. Now the conditions for the `target users` would be {`gender`: "", `age`: "", `occupation`: "", `genres`: "" }. Add the recommended movies based on the new range of `target users`.
    </div>
    </details>

<br>


2. **Recommendation by movie information**

   > By **movie information**, we mean a `movie title` and a `limit number`. When given **movie information**, `VIM PROJECTOR` will recommend high-rated movies similar to the given movie and up to the given `limit number`. The similarity of the movies are assessed by the `genres` of the movies.
   > The steps in this algorithm are shown below.
   >
   > 1.  Generate a list of recommended movies that are in the **same genres** as the given movie.
   > 2.  If the number of movies in the generated list is less than the given `limit number`, add the recommended movies that belong to genres that **include all the genres** of the given movie to the list.
   > 3.  If the number of movies in the generated list is still less than the given `limit number`, add the recommended movies that belong to **at least one genre** of the given movie.
   > 4.  If the number of movies in the generated list is still less than the given `limit number`, add the recommended movies that belong to **all genres**.

    <details>
    <summary>Show an example</summary>
    <div markdown="1">
    <br>

   > Let’s see an example of {`title`: "Toy Story (1995)", `limit`: 20} given as an input of `movie information`. The `genres` of this movie are `Animation`, `Children's`, and `Comedy`. A list of 20 recommended movies should be generated.
   >
   > According to this algorithm, the generation of a movie recommendation list would follow the process shown below.
   >
   > 1.  A list of recommended movies is generated from the data of movies that only belong to all three `genres` of `Animation`, `Children's`, and `Comedy` at once. The generated list contains only one movie.
   > 2.  Then recommendations are searched within the data of movies that belong to all three `genres` and more. One such example would be a movie that belongs to `genres` of `Animation`, `Children’s`, `Comedy` and `Action`. However, in this case there are no movies added to the list.
   > 3.  Now the recommendations are searched from the data of movies that belong to at least one `genre` of the given three `genres`. This means that the recommended movies could belong to any one `genre` from `Animation`, `Children’s`, or `Comedy`, or to any two of these `genres`. In this example, there are 19 movies added to the generated list.
   > 4.  In this example, the list of 20 recommended movies is now generated. However, if the number of movies in the generated list is still less than the given `limit number`, add the recommended movies that belong to **all genres**.
